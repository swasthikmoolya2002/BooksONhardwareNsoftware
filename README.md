# Books On Software and Hardware

This repository will be having many computer software and hardware books that are reviewed for engineering students to get out of the box knowledge.

It would be hard to find genuine books on internet, So its my contribution in providing these materials. My aim is to make people whoever are in need of these materials must utilise this via github. PLEASE DO SHARE THIS REPOSITORY LINKS WITH YOUR FELLOW MATES
